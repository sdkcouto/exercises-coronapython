#Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.

favorite_number = {'flavio' : '24', 'joao' : '69', 'matheus' : '420', 'dudu' : '120', 'pedro' : '0'}

print(favorite_number['flavio'])
print(favorite_number['joao'])
print(favorite_number['matheus'])
print(favorite_number['dudu'])
print(favorite_number['pedro'])
print(favorite_number)
