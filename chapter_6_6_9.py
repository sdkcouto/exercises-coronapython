# Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.

favorite_places = {'Matheus' : ['Toronto'],
    'Thales' : ['Rio de janeiro'],
    'Thais' : ['Macae']
    }
for name, places in favorite_places.items():
    for place in places:
        print(name + "' favorite place is " + place + ".")
