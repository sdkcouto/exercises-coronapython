# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names=[" Matheus ", " Dudu ", " Andre "]
print("Hello"+names[0]+"how are you?")
print("Hello"+names[1]+"how are you?")
print("Hello"+names[2]+"how are you?")
