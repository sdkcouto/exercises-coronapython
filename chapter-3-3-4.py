# 3-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

presidents = ["Lula", "Bolsonaro", "Putin"]
print("hey, "+ presidents[0] + " would you like to have dinner?")
print("hey, "+ presidents[1] + " would you like to have dinner?")
print("hey, "+ presidents[2] + " would you like to have dinner?")
