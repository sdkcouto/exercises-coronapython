# A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

#• Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.
programming_words = {'print' : 'pra printar', 'if' : 'para condicionais', 'and' : 'conjuncao para condicionais', 'or' : 'conjuncao para condicionais', 'str' : 'para transformar em string'}

#• Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.

print(programming_words['print'])
print(programming_words['if'])
print(programming_words['and'])
print(programming_words['or'])
